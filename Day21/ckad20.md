# CKA Full Course 2025: Key Concepts and Insights

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes the core concepts from the *"Tech Tutorials with Piyush"* YouTube series, **CKA Full Course 2025**.  
The series is a comprehensive, 40-part tutorial designed to prepare viewers for the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** exam, based on the latest **2024 CNCF curriculum**.  

It begins with foundational Docker concepts before systematically progressing through **Kubernetes architecture, core objects, scheduling, networking, and operational best practices**.  

The approach emphasizes **hands-on learning**, with each video including practical demonstrations, sample code, and assignments available in a dedicated GitHub repository.

A central theme is the **transition from managing single containers with Docker** to **orchestrating resilient applications at scale with Kubernetes**.  
Key Kubernetes components like the **control plane** (API Server, Scheduler, etcd, Controller Manager) and **worker nodes** (Kubelet, Kube-proxy) are explained in depth.  

The course also provides instructions for setting up a multi-node local cluster using **kind** (Kubernetes in Docker) and managing it via **kubectl**.

## Part 1: Docker and Container Fundamentals

### The Pre-Container Problem
- Environment misconfigurations  
- Missing dependencies  
- Friction between Dev and Ops  

### The Solution: Containers
- Portable, isolated environments  
- *Build → Ship → Run* paradigm  
- Docker (most popular runtime)  

### Containers vs Virtual Machines

| Feature           | Virtual Machine (VM)                     | Container                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Analogy           | House for one family                     | Flat in a shared building                   |
| Architecture      | Full guest OS on hypervisor              | Shares host OS kernel                       |
| Resource Usage    | Heavy (CPU/RAM per VM)                   | Lightweight, efficient                      |
| Isolation         | Strong hardware-level                    | Process-level isolation                     |
| Startup Time      | Minutes                                  | Seconds                                     |
| Image Size        | GBs                                      | MBs                                         |

### Docker Workflow
1. **Dockerfile** → Instructions for building images.  
2. **Docker Image** → Immutable, portable artifact.  
3. **Docker Registry** → Stores/publishes images (e.g., Docker Hub).  
4. **Docker Container** → Running instance of an image.  

Commands:
```bash
docker build -t app .
docker push user/app
docker pull user/app
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 app
````

### Best Practice: Multi-Stage Builds

* Stage 1: Build + compile dependencies
* Stage 2: Copy only final artifacts into a minimal runtime image

---

## Part 2: Introduction to Kubernetes

### The Problem: Docker at Scale

* No self-healing
* Manual scaling
* Difficult rolling updates
* Ephemeral IPs → unreliable networking

### The Solution: Kubernetes

Automates container orchestration: self-healing, scaling, networking, service discovery.

---

## Kubernetes Architecture

### Control Plane (Cluster "Brain")

* **API Server**: Gateway for kubectl + clients
* **etcd**: Key-value store of cluster state
* **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes
* **Controller Manager**: Runs controllers (e.g., ReplicaSet, Node)

### Worker Nodes (Run workloads)

* **Kubelet**: Ensures pods are running on node
* **Kube-proxy**: Handles service networking & load balancing
* **Container runtime**: Docker, containerd, CRI-O

---

## The Pod: The Smallest Unit

* One or more containers grouped together
* Shared **network namespace, storage, and resources**
* Patterns:

  * **Single-container pod** (most common)
  * **Multi-container pod** (sidecar, init, adapters)

---

## Part 3: Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster

* **kind**: Kubernetes in Docker → lightweight clusters
* **kubectl**: CLI to interact with cluster

Examples:

```bash
kind create cluster --name cka
kubectl get nodes
alias k=kubectl
```

### Imperative vs Declarative

* Imperative: Direct commands (`kubectl run ...`)
* Declarative: YAML configs applied via `kubectl apply -f`

---

## YAML Fundamentals

Every object includes:

```yaml
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
spec:
```

Generate YAML:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
```

---

## Part 4: Core Kubernetes Objects

### Controllers

* **ReplicaSet**: Ensures fixed number of pod replicas
* **Deployment**: Manages ReplicaSets, rolling updates, rollbacks

### Networking with Services

* **ClusterIP** (default, internal only)
* **NodePort** (expose via <NodeIP>:<NodePort>)
* **LoadBalancer** (cloud load balancer)
* **ExternalName** (CNAME mapping)

---

## Scheduling and Resources

* **Static Pods**: Managed by kubelet directly
* **Labels/Selectors**: For grouping + targeting pods
* **Taints/Tolerations**: Nodes repel pods unless tolerated
* **Node Affinity**: Pods prefer/require nodes with matching labels
* **Requests & Limits**: CPU/memory guarantees and caps

---

## Workloads & Health

* **Init Containers**: Setup before main app runs
* **Sidecars**: Helpers (e.g., logging, service mesh proxy)

Other workload types:

* **DaemonSet** → One pod per node
* **Job** → Runs to completion
* **CronJob** → Scheduled jobs

Health Probes:

* **Liveness** → Restart if unhealthy
* **Readiness** → Remove from service until ready
* **Startup** → Delay probes until startup completes

---

## Configuration & Security

* **ConfigMaps** → Non-sensitive config
* **Secrets** → Sensitive data (base64 encoded)
* **SSL/TLS** → Foundations for securing traffic in Kubernetes
